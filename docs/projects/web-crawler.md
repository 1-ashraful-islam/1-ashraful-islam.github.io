# Web Crawler

This is a semi-guided project from boot.dev backend developer course. The objective of the project is to create a web crawler that can crawl a website and generate a report on the internal-linking profile of the website. This project is written in Javascript.

## What benefits does this project provide?

Webcrawler that provide internal linking profile of a website can be used for the following purposes:

* SEO Optimization: Internal links help search engines understand the structure and hierarchy of a website. Analyzing these links can help identify which pages are considered most important and how effectively the link structure supports SEO.

* User Navigation Analysis: Understanding internal linking helps in analyzing how users might navigate through a site. This can lead to improvements in user experience and site architecture.

* Identifying Orphan Pages: A crawler can find pages that are not linked from anywhere else on the site, known as orphan pages. These pages are typically invisible to search engines and users, so identifying them is crucial.

* Link Equity Distribution: Internal links distribute 'link equity' around a site. A crawler can help in understanding how this equity is spread and whether it aligns with the siteâ€™s strategic goals.

* Content Strategy Insights: By examining internal links, you can understand how different content pieces are interconnected, which can inform content strategy and reveal gaps or overemphasis in certain areas.

* Detecting Broken Links: It can identify broken internal links, which are detrimental to user experience and SEO.

* Page Depth Analysis: Understanding how many clicks it takes to reach a page from the homepage (page depth) can be crucial for SEO and user experience.

* Audit and Compliance: For large websites, ensuring that internal linking adheres to certain standards or guidelines can be important for compliance and quality assurance.
