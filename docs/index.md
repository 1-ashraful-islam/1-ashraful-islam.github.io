Welcome to my personal website. I am Ashraful Islam. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems.

I am currently tinkering with on-device inference of LLMs to create a privacy-preserving AI assistant. I am also auding a backend development course from boot.dev to improve my backend development skills.
