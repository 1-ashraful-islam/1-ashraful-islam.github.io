Turning 30 came with the crippling realization that I have lived a significant portion of my life. When it comes to taking risk, I have tried to minimize things that could go wrong. The longer I stayed in my last job, the more I felt like I was the frog that started in tepid water.

When I first joined the company as a mechanical engineer contractor, it felt warm and welcoming. I saw challenges and potential career growth. Based on the on-site interview and tour, I thought I could combine my knowledge and passion for computer science and mechanical engineering together. However, very soon, I realized as a contractor I am treated like a third class citizen of the company

"When I first joined the company, it felt like stepping into a comfortable bath — the environment was warm and welcoming, with challenges that seemed invigorating. However, over time, the heat was turned up so gradually that I hardly noticed. Workloads increased, the culture shifted, and my own well-being began to simmer unnoticed. It wasn't until I felt myself on the verge of boiling over — completely burned out and disillusioned — that I recognized the peril I was in. Leaving was my way of jumping out of the pot, a decision made to preserve my health and happiness. This experience taught me the critical importance of being aware of my surroundings and the conditions I'm willing to tolerate, ensuring I never again ignore the signs of the water heating around me."
